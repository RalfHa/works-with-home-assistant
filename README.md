Stuff that works with Home Assistant with minimal aggravation. If you have to reflash the device, please add that to the description.

## Hubs

* [GoControl CECOMINOD016164 HUSBZB-1 USB Hub](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GJ826F8) - USB device with both Z-Wave and Zigbee radios.

## Z-Wave

A note on dimmers: Lutron holds a patent for sending status back to hubs on their RadioRA2 system. Not all zwave dimmers license this patent, so some act weird. Leviton is known to license this patent, and their dimmers work well.
