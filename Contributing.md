# Contributing

First and foremost, thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions, and the list wouldn't be nearly as complete without them. You may add to the list by submitting a pull request or adding a link in an issue.

## Entry Guidelines

### General

- Entries should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Please only make entries for devices you have _personally_ used. You can't say something works well if you haven't worked with it yourself.
- Please include a link to purchase each addition to the list. Don't include referral codes in the links, but also please use smile.amazon.com for Amazon links so people can contribute easily to their preferred charities when they buy.
- Amazon links should be in the form https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/XYZZY/
- If the item needs to be reflashed with Tasmota, ESPHome or something else before it is usable with Home Assistant, make sure to put that in the **Notes** column.
- If the device you're adding won't work in a local-only mode, please say so in the **Notes** column of your entry.
- If it requires a remote service, definitely note that - I prefer to not buy anything that will brick if the vendor goes out of business or decides to cancel the product line.
- If it tries to phone home - note that too.
- For consistency in entries, please capitalize Tasmota and ESPHome.
- For consistency, please spell Z-Wave with a dash instead of ZWave.
- For consistency, we always spell Zigbee and Z-Wave with a capital Z.
- The list is split into sections for Hubs, Wifi devices, Z-Wave devices and Zigbee devices. Please keep the sections sorted alphabetically.
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line, with capitalization consistent with the other entries in the section.
- Paragraphs in the **Description** and **Notes** columns should be single lines with no internal line breaks. We let GitHub's markdown formatter handle adding any required line breaks rather than embedding breaks in the entries, this also allows us to work with any browser window width.
- Your PR should pass the PR automatic checks. If the checks show an error that you didn't make (a previous entry has gone 404, for example) you don't _have_ to fix those errors, though I'll certainly appreciate the help if you do, or if you create an issue documenting the problem so I can fix it.

## To remove an entry:

Open an issue to discuss why the entry should be removed, or create a PR.

Entries that have gone 404 do not require an issue to remove - just make a PR.
